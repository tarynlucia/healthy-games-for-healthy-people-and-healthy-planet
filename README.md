## Games for Healthy People and Healthy Planet [Food Hero Calculator]

## Project Timeline/Status: 
This project is in its second year as a capstone, building on work from the previous team. This year‚Äôs contributions included implementing usability improvements, developing a comparison feature, creating an interactive game, and adding explanatory content for environmental footprints. This year we also conducted prtotype testing with the target audience. 

## Team Members and Roles: 
- **Aaron Underhill** - Front end, communications 
- **Abdulrahman Samargandi** - Front end, responsible for dealing with project deadlines
- **Anastasiia Ragozina** - Front end, facilitator
- **Charissa Mia Wai Jun Kau** - Front end, notetaker
- **Taryn Eng** - Front end, notetaker
- **Yaire Aguilar Carrion** - Front end, facilitator

## Problem Statement: 
Most existing websites  focus only on the nutritional value of food, overlooking its environmental impact. The Food Hero Calculator fills this gap by combining nutrition facts with carbon and water footprint data to generate a single, easy-to-understand summary. The Food Hero Calculator bridges this gap by offering an engaging platform where kids learn about:

- Carbon & water footprints of foods
- Nutrition facts
- Sustainable decision-making

## Target Audience:
- **Children (3rd‚Äì8th grade):** Need an intuitive, game-like experience to learn about food choices and their environmental impact.
- **Parents:** Look for accessible, educational tools that teach children sustainability and health in a fun way.
- **Educators:** Require a platform that is easy to integrate into classroom lessons and that clearly communicates environmental and nutritional concepts.
- **Youth-focused organizations and institutions:** Seek reliable teaching tools for promoting sustainable food practices.

This project offers children an engaging, kid-friendly educational tool that teaches essential facts about sustainability and health, fostering lifelong skills. By promoting environmental awareness early on, the project aims to develop climate-conscious, health-focused individuals through interactive learning.
(put the old vercel link here then update it with our version once its published)

The **Food Hero Calculator** educates children on the environmental impacts of their food choices‚Äîspecifically carbon and water footprints‚Äîencouraging better decisions for the planet. Through a fun, interactive app, young users gain insights into how different foods impact the environment, helping them build a foundation for eco-friendly habits. Ultimately, this project seeks to address gaps in environmental education and inspire a new generation of informed, environmentally conscious food citizens.

For institutions and educators, the platform must be interactive and effective in teaching food sustainability. For children, it must be playful, intuitive, and educational.

## Architecture
For the architecture of our program it can be divided into 3 different parts which I will go over briefly and more into details in the demo.  First, the program is currently supported on Safari and Chrome browsers for end users. For the front-end, the program is built with React, CSS and Javascript. And finally we have the website deployed via Vercel. Where it automatically builds and hosts the application from the connected repository, ensuring seamless updates with every push.

## Getting Started

- git remote add [Your name to represent Gerald's Forked Repo on your local machine] [The url for Gerald's Forked Repo]
- git fetch [same forked name represented above (not the url)]
- git checkout -b [Your name for Gerald's branch] [Geralds GitHub username/the name of Gerald's branch that you want to fetch]

Example: If Sally were cloning Gerald's fork

- git remote add sally-fork https://github.com/ghendrix-git/healthy-games-for-healthy-people-and-healthy-planet.git
- git fetch sally-fork
- git checkout -b sally-branch sally-fork/initial-commit

Then, run npm install

With the code on you local machine navagate to the branches root directory.

# Database Information

You will need to create an .env.local folder for accessing Supabase data in the main directory. In this folder you will add the Supabase Database URL and ANON KEY. The URL and KEY are protected and will require admin authorization from the Project Administrator. 

Run the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `food_app/pages/home.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Obstacles
Throughout this project, we encountered several challenges that required problem-solving, communication, and adaptability. Below are some key issues we faced and how we addressed them:

### üêû Code Wouldn‚Äôt Work
- **Challenge**: For our personal coding parts, we ran into issues with the code not working as expected.
- **Solution**: Debugging the code and asking for help from others.
- **Lesson Learned**: Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for help; collaboration speeds up problem-solving.
- **Impact**: Improved team collaboration and better understanding of the codebase.

### üìÖ Registering for the Bend Conference
- **Challenge**: Difficulty registering due to communication gaps.
- **Solution**: Back-and-forth communication with our Project Mentor helped clarify the process.
- **Lesson Learned**: Ask questions early and often to avoid confusion.
- **Impact**: Led to team confusion and missing the submission deadline.

### ‚è∞ Finding a Prototype Testing Group/Time
- **Challenge**: Coordinating availability for testing sessions.
- **Solution**: Effective communication and searching for overlapping availability.
- **Lesson Learned**: Start planning early to ensure smoother scheduling.
- **Impact**: Created uncertainty and delays in our testing timeline.

### üß™ Deciding on a Second Round of Testing
- **Challenge**: Uncertainty about whether to conduct a second round of prototype testing.
- **Solution**: We communicated with our PRAx leader and collectively decided not to proceed.
- **Lesson Learned**: Be more decisive and proactive as a group.
- **Impact**: Last-minute decisions led to rushed communication and responses.

### üé® Reconfiguring Our Expo Poster
